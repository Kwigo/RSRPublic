## What is Run Suhsi, Run! ?
RSR! is a runner game, where the main character moves automatically from left to right.\
The player needs to jump and dash to avoid enemies or running into walls.\
If you hit an enemy or a wall, you get sent back to the beginning of the level.\

## What's next?
As you can probably see if you've played the demo, it's *extremely* barebones at the moment.\
First, I'm gonna add some more levels and some proper pixel art. Music will also be added fairly soon.\
Once the gameplay is finalized, there'll also be a scoring system.

## How can I give feedback?
The easiest way if we don't know each other personally, is to open an issue in this Github repo.
